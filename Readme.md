# Youtube Search

A simple application to search youtube videos built with html, css and javascript.  
You can see the final result [here](http://cauequeiroz.com.br/youtube-search).

To run this application on your computer you have to:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:cauequeiroz/youtube-search.git
$ cd youtube-search
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

After that, the application will be running at *localhost:8080*.

To speak with the Youtube API I'm using a very tiny client coded by myself:  
[http://npmjs.com/package/youtube-api-client](http://npmjs.com/package/youtube-api-client)  
[https://github.com/cauequeiroz/youtube-api-client](https://github.com/cauequeiroz/youtube-api-client)

That's all, folks :)
